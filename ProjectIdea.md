My Idea is to create an income calculator.  This would allow the user to put in (regular, overtime and doubletime) hours worked and base wages and it would return the gross amount to be expected on their check.

This idea is based on my work with Local 16 where I would work for multiple employers and I had to track income and budget accordingly.

The beauty of this project is that the scope can be very simple but it also could expand to be more complex.
